DMA seems to have a 1 cycle startup delay at least in "start immediately" mode.

Key:
SRC = Source Address
DST = Destination Address
NR = Nonsequential Read (from SRC)
NW = Nonsequential Write (to DST)
SR = Sequential Read (from SRC)
SW = Sequential Write (to DST)

Once DMA has started the timings are as follows:
1. NR
2. NW
3. if NR takes < 2 cycles then it stalls for a cycle here for some reason? (this occurs at the same time as any write contention)
5. SR (note: if the SRC is MainRAM then it appears to start prefetching the next word after this point? This allows further reads to be done in one cycle.)
6. SW
7. SR
8. SW
