Welcome to DualSOUP the spiritual successor to my abandoned emulator VitaminC

Mission Statement:
Improve preservation of the NDS/DSi/3DS library and their hardware via accurate emulation at ANY cost to usability and performance.

Priorities:
Accuracy above all else:
    If the logic can be made 1 bit or one cycle more accurate I'm going to take the more accurate option.
    I anticipate most sacrifices here will be due to lack of knowledge in the area.
Performance:
    This level of accuracy requires a lot of complex logic to handle cases that most emulators don't (and frankly probably shouldn't) bother with.
    So we are going to need as much performance as we can squeeze out of this thing if we want this to be usable.
Maintainability:
    I need to be able to actually rewrite and fix things or else we're going to rapidly hit a brick wall.
