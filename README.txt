Welcome to DualSOUP the spiritual successor to my abandoned emulator VitaminC

Mission Statement:
Improve preservation of the NDS/DSi/3DS library and their hardware via accurate emulation at ANY cost to usability and performance.

Priorities:
Accuracy above all else:
    If the logic can be made 1 bit or one cycle more accurate I'm going to take the more accurate option.
    I anticipate most sacrifices here will be due to lack of knowledge in the area.
Performance:
    This level of accuracy requires a lot of complex logic to handle cases that most emulators don't (and frankly probably shouldn't) bother with.
    So we are going to need as much performance as we can squeeze out of this thing if we want this to be usable.
Maintainability:
    I need to be able to actually rewrite and fix things or else we're going to rapidly hit a brick wall.

Plan:
1. Emulate a pretend model based on some mix of various model's characteristics with the goal of focusing purely on the classic DS/DSLite's functionality.
2. Skip DSi, start emulating the 3DS. (I dont actually have a DSi to work with currently.... at the very least I can get enough of the 3DS hardware working to boot TWL_Firm?)
3. Either begin focusing on 3DS style DSi support, or actually focus on emulating the 3DS.

Notes:
    Do not expect me to add any enhancements. Any enhancements that do get added may be removed at any point in the future should I deem them uneccessary for the emulator's design goals.
    I can and will require Cards/Carts to be redumped at any point if I deem older dumps to be insufficiently complete.

Low priority goals:
Wifi:
    This one is just a lot of effort and something I do not have any knowledge in.
    I do really want at least functional wifi at some point though due to how important it is to the system, so it's probably the highest priority one here.
Most special expansion hardware:
    I think three IR Cards and two RTC GBA Carts are the only interesting ones I own.
    I'd prefer to prioritize getting core functionality down first before focusing on emulating hardware only a few games use.
GBA backwards compatibility modes:
    I dont really have much passion for the GBA personally and GBA emulation already has really good high accuracy emulators.
    This is probably the lowest priority goal here.
